- INITIALIZING Migrate
migrate create -ext=sql -dir=sql/migrations -seq init

- Command to start a migration | verbose means to be a description of what happened | up means creating the tables how that script says.
migrate -path=sql/migrations -database "mysql://root:root@tcp(localhost:3306)/courses" -verbose up

- Command to drop|delete the migration made
migrate -path=sql/migrations -database "mysql://root:root@tcp(localhost:3306)/courses" -verbose down

- Create Makefile to registry of commands, so once command created, we can run:
make migrate
make migratedown

Attention:
.PHONY: migrate migratedown createmigration <- This means it doesn't run files with those names, only runs the instructions

to install him:
- sudo snap install sqlc

----------- || ---------------|| --------------

sqlc generate
