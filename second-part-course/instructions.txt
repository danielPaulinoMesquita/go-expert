SWAGGER - GO
first all, we need to install the binaries of swagger, after configuring the env in ~/.bashrc to point for bin of go

ref: https://github.com/swaggo/swag

-Every time you should put a documentation on the APIs,
you need to run swag init

swag init --parseDependency -g cmd/server/main.go

- when you want to create a doc for your apis, you run this command

swag init  --parseDependency -g cmd/server/main.go

but, it can happen a problem or simply not generate the doc
so, you can go to the dir, where is the file with the apis and generate there the command

swag init --parseDependency -g user-handlers.go

then, get the lines of docs just generated in doc from your current directory and paste them on the main file of swagger, that is placed /cmd/server/docs
now, it will work .
