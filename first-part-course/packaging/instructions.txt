One way to import a package or module from your local, you can use --replace
example:
 go mod edit -replace github.com/danielPaulinoMesquita/go-expert/packaging/math=../math

so this instruction rather to download from repository(remote) it will catch in the local, specifically "../math"

example 2:
* Working with go work:
 go work init ./math ./cmd

This way is much more efficient because it doesn't dirt the file go.mod with instructions replace

one code snippet from go.work
use (
	./cmd
	./math
)

this key word points to the paths where cmd and math are located.

ATTENTION: When you use workspaces in your project, you can't download or import modules automatic with go mod tidy.

So, to download something, you can use the go get {nameofLib}

or

go mod tidy -e

this command will ignore all packages that can't be found and download only them can be found
